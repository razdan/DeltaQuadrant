<h1> Building a Cloud-based Development Platform </h1> 


Cloud-based Development Platform (CDP) allows developers to write/build code using cloud computing resources instead of local development machines. Application workloads are rapidly migrating to cloud and migration of development workloads is a logical progression of that trend.

CDE tools are quickly gaining traction, and their adoption trajectory is similar to that of github (that replaced local source control systems) and for similar reasons. CDE increases developer productivity by:

- Quickly on-boarding new project team members by eliminating repetitive stack installation on each machine
- Enabling collaborative peer coding/reviews/testing/debugging
- Enabling testing teams to quickly set-up (and tear down) environments for testing specific modules of large and complex applications
- Pre-configured integration with other cloud PaaS services (AWS, Cloudinary  )
- Social collaboration: Enabling technical discussions and knowledge sharing within wider developer community on the web

In addition, CDE further increases productivity, lowers costs, and improves quality by:

- Enabling product managers (and doc teams) to test new features in sandbox environment before code hits production
- Enabling DevOps to monitor stack drifts between developement environments and production environments
- Eliminates need for expensive development machine for each developer for running resource
- Eliminates risk of loss of productivity due to local machine failures

<h2> The Market </h2>
CDP is an emerging sub-segment of PaaS market (IDC estimates overall PaaS to hit $14 Billion by 2017) that is expected to grow quickly due to high interest in faster development-to-deployment cycles and and lower costs. Due to this reason the market is quickly getting crowded with many products touting similar capabilities and less perceivable differentiation. Larger PaaS vendors like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform are quite likely to enter this in near future.

<h2> The Product </h2>
The winning product in CDE market will display following characteristics  :

<h3> Rapid Adoption </h3>

Developer communities display tribe like characteristics. New members gravitate towards tools already used by existing members in the interest of tapping into existing knowledge and in the process unleashing network effect. Also, software business is a winner takes all game where products with rapid adoption are harder to displace . To achieve rapid adoption the winning product will have laser focus on specific (but significant enough) problem-set and stand out amongst competition. The key is to identity and focus on biggest pain points and unmet needs before expanding out into adjacent problem sets.

Example 1: Testers and Product managers are key participants in validating the release before it hits production. Yet, their needs are not being adequately met by todayâ€™s code-to-deploy technical infrastructure. They have to either create dev environments on their machines or wait till code is released into QA sandbox. Ideally, testers and PM can validate completed unit stories upstream in the process and provide feedback.

Example 2: Success of sites like Stack Overflow emphasizes importance of social collaboration, knowledge sharing (for everyday work) and reputation building (over time) for developers. Winning CDE will bake these capabilities deep inside the platform, and naturally build the proverbial moat around business.

<h3> Integration Backbone </h3>

Open source community is a prolific contributor of development tools and new tools emerge all the time. Support for newer told is imperative for CDE platform. Winning CDE platform will have an extensible integration capability that makes it easy to integrate with newer tools easily and quickly.

<h3> Service focus </h3>

Traditional development tool vendors compete on feature set, but cloud is a service business. Winning CDE vendor will have top- notch service infrastructure - both in terms of platform availability and responsiveness but also efficient and scalable servicing of developer needs by providing topnotch technical documentation and self-service tools.
