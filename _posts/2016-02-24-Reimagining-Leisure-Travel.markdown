<h1> Reimagining Leisure Travel </h1>

OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) have transformed leisure travel over last decade and now account for almost 40% of all travel bookings. Two key innovations introduced by first generation OTAs included ‘competitive price discovery and comparison' and 'booking convenience'. Ubiquitous connectivity into digitial social fabric and recent innovations such as sharing economy and  peer-to-peer interactions are  presenting new opportunities for market-entry and value creation/capture  for next generation of OTAs.

This note presents some ideas for next-gen OTAs for creating delightful experiences for leisure travelers over next decade.

<h2> The Market </h2>

Domestic Leisure Travel Market

- Direct spending on leisure travel in US by domestic and international travelers totaled $644.9 billion in 2014.

- Each overseas traveler spends approximately $4,400 when they visit the U.S. and stays an average of 18 nights.
- Top leisure activities for overseas visitors: (1) shopping, (2) sightseeing; (3) fine dining; (4) national parks/monuments and (5) amusement/theme parks.

1. Prospective traveler researches travel destinations using various online and offline research/recommendations. Current set of OTAs play very limited role in this stage.

2. Traveler completes travel bookings using an OTA. Main considerations usually being desired/availability dates and prices. Current set of OTAs heavily focus on value creation/capture in this stage.

3. During travel, travelers partake in various experiences based on individual preferences, traveler demographic and interests. Current set of OTAs play very limited or no role in this stage.

<h3> Pain points for travelers </h3>

Lack of modern travel research tools

Traveler has to spend considerable time planning the travel/vacation. This includes researching, shortlisting and finalizing destinations and activites. Travelers have to research and stitch together travel experience they aspire.

Lack of ‘Experience Ratings'

While players like routehappy.com, Zagat and Michelin have created uniform rating systems for air travels and restaurants, no such ratings are available for many other travel experiences. Travelers have to rely on non-standard ratings aggregated using consumer provided star-ratings and comments

Lack of flexibility

Most consumers take a narrow approach to travel planning that over emphasizes date availability and prices, and end up with loss of flexibility that can impact travel experience. Design of first generation OTA websites reinforces this approach. This can lead to vanilla travel experience and limited flexibility during travel.

<h3> Pain points for Service Providers </h3>

- Downward pressure on inventory prices and business margins

OTAs account for large portion of bookings for service providers (mainly hotels and air travel) and charge a premium for order flow in terms of commissions. Further, OTA market has consolidated around 3 or 4 major OTAs and resulting lack of distribution channels puts downward pressure on inventory pricing

- Loss of customer loyalty

OTA-driven travel bookings undermine service provider loyalty programs and result in ever increasing cost of customer acquisition.

<h3> Pain points for OTAs </h3>
- High cost of customer acquisition

In the current model, the OTA-Traveler relationship is very transaction oriented. OTAs have to keep on spending on marketing and customer acquisition ( e.g. Ad-words) to get repeat transactions.

- Market saturation

The Big-three OTAs (Expedia, Priceline, Trip Advisor ) combined account for most of online travel bookings in US and Europe. They face strong local completion in newer markets such as China and India and are looking for newer growth markets (e.g. restaurant reservations)

- Newer alternatives

Rise of sharing economy and players like AirBnB continue to shift travel dollars from hotels to options such as peer-to-peer lodging

<h2> Opportunities for Next-Gen Meta-OTA </h2>

High cost of customer acquisition to operate at scale is a significant barrier to entry in the OTA market. However, as players like AirBnB have demonstrated, there is always opportunity for innovators who think outside of existing models. The strategic goal is to create new offerings for travelers that can both add and extract value from the existing OTA market/ecosystem.

<h2> The Product </h2>
Next-gen OTAs have an opportunity to design the travel experience from Traveler’s perspective. This requires a Traveler-First approach that focuses on the traveler and his/her aspirations and takes an end-to-end view of the travel experience instead of jumping right into and being limited to booking transactions.

<h3> Focus on Experiences </h3>

Core component of this new Travel-first model are to start with designing various ‘experience templates’ that incorporate different types of services that together provide a certain type of experience.  For example, ‘Foodie Experience in France’ for foodies would include visits to acclaimed restaurants, visits to wineries in Bordeaux region etc., in addition to a quick visit to Versailles.

<h3> Redefining Discovery by matching aspirational experiences to curated templates </h3>


From the traveler perspective, the classic discovery phase is replaced with ‘experience design’ where traveler indicate their travel aspirations and OTAs match it to pre-designed/curated experience templates that include standard ‘series’ that are rated on a well-deinfed and consistent scale.

Travelers can choose to partake in the travel experience with a predetermined groups (e.g. Family), solo or request to be matched other travelers looking for similar experience. Such aggregations also offer an opportunity to get better prices from the service providers. example: One ‘Biking inner lanes of Budapest’ peer-to-peer guide can offer better prices to a group of traveler.

<h3> Fulfillment </h3>

Standard services that make up the experience packages are fulfilled by service providers who programmatically bid to fulfill services in real-time as travelers are designing and pricing their ‘travel experiences’. Service provides include professional as well as peer to peer service providers.

Bookings of Hotels, Air fares, Car rentals etc. is modeled as a service and  outsourced to classic OTA  (programmatically using OTA API)

Once the traveler purchases an experience package, next-gen OTA acts like a personal assistant keeping track of changes (and adjusting accordingly), providing updates on weather,  ‘packing list’ suggestions and information about local customs and trivia etc.

Once the traveler starts the travel, next-gen OTA logistics and fulfillment automation takes care of seamlessly connecting the traveler with the service providers using smart phones/app.

Travelers can swap out services and service providers to accommodate for any unplanned changes in travel or travelers mood.

Integration with various social services (Meerkat, Instagram etc.) allows the traveler to share the experience with friends and loved ones in unique manner - and in the process creating digital memorabilia they’ll always cherish. Imagine a photo-book at your doorstep as soon as you return from your travels.

Travelers provide instant feedback for individual services adding immediacy and accuracy to the feedback system.

<h3> Market Positioning and Entry </h3>

The product described above is offered as a membership product with a nominal annual membership fee  (like Gilt etc.). The membership fee is used to establish the value perception and is not meant to be main source of revenue. Main source of revenue is generated from transaction fee (percent of transaction) charged to service providers.

The initial marketing strategy is to use digital placements in digital properties that target specific demographics. A select number of lottery (for members) that offers free or deeply discounted travel experiences will be used to launch a PR campaign to introduce the concept of Experience Travel.

<h2> Product Execution Plan </h2>

To be discussed.
