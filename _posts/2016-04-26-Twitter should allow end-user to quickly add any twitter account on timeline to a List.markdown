<h1> Twitter, allow end-user to quickly add any twitter account from timeline to an existing list </h1>

Most twitter users use Lists to thematically organize twitter accounts they follow. E.g. Sports list contains all accounts that publish sports themed tweets (e.g. @ESPNNBA, @CNN Sport). Currently user has to navigate to List management page and manually add new account to the list. Iâ€™d like a feature that allows me to quickly add twitter account to one of my existing lists right from my timeline
